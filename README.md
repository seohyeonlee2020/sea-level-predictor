# Sea Level Predictor

![sea level plot with 2 regression lines extrapolated to 2050](https://github.com/seohyeonlee2020/sea-level-predictor/blob/main/sea_level_plot.png)

This challenge uses data from EPA to predict sea levels up to 2050. I learned to extrapolate linear data with scipy.stats.linregress. My work can be found on sea_level_predictor.py and an .ipynb file with the same name. The rest are unit testing and gitpod setup files from a freeCodeCamp boilerplate.
